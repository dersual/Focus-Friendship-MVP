# Focus Friendship

This project is for "Focus Friendship," a web application that gamifies focus sessions using a digital pet.

## Approved Technical Plan

### Phase 1: Core Pet & Progress MVP
This phase focuses on the essential loop: focusing to evolve a single pet.
1.  **Backend & Setup:** Complete the simple Express backend for session logging.
2.  **Asset Generation:** Create placeholder images for the visible evolution stages of the first pet.
3.  **Core Services:** Implement services to manage XP and leveling for a single pet in `localStorage`.
4.  **Core UI:** Build the `Timer` component and the `CutieBean` pet component that visibly changes as it levels up.

### Phase 2: Customization & Goals
This phase expands the core experience with more personalization.
1.  **Expand Core Services:** Rework the services to manage a collection of multiple pets and user-defined goals.
2.  **New UI - Goals:** Build a `GoalManager` component for users to set and track personal goals.
3.  **New UI - Pet Switching:** Build a `PetSelector` component to allow users to switch between different unlocked pets.

### Phase 3: Social & Scheduling Features (Future)
1.  **User Authentication:** Implement "Sign in with Google."
2.  **Database Integration:** Add a full database to the backend.
3.  **Friends System & Calendar:** Implement friends lists and Google Calendar integration.

## User-Defined Rules
- also explain and show everything step by step, after showing the plan, allow me a chance to approve or not approve it, and then do this step by step
- keep the 2 phase structure, just push back scheduling with friends to phase 3 ig (interpreted as a 3-phase structure)
